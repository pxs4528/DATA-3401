So is it not with me #s with th#t Muse
Stirr'd by # p#inted be#uty to his verse,
Who he#ven itself for orn#ment doth use
And every f#ir with his f#ir doth rehe#rse
M#king # couplement of proud comp#re,
With sun #nd moon, with e#rth #nd se#'s rich gems,
With April's first-born flowers, #nd #ll things r#re
Th#t he#ven's #ir in this huge rondure hems.
O' let me, true in love, but truly write,
And then believe me, my love is #s f#ir
As #ny mother's child, though not so bright
As those gold c#ndles fix'd in he#ven's #ir:
Let them s#y more th#n like of he#rs#y well;
I will not pr#ise th#t purpose not to sell.
